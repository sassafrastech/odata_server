# OData Server

This is a rails plugin/engine to embue your application with OData features (so its data can be readily
consumed by an OData client).

In OData, a service exposes a number of workspace. Each workspace is backed by a schema and contains
a collection of entity collections. An entity collection is a related set of records.

Configure the plugin by adding a number of schema objects to `OData::Edm::DataServices.schemas`. Each
schema is an instance of a subclass of `OData::AbstractSchema::Base`. We currently only support two
implementations, and the specific implementation determines how to load the records, mapping the
records' properties to/from Edm data types, and handling filtering, sorting, and data retrieval.

- OData::ActiveRecordSchema::Base -- either you give it a list or it iterate over all your models exposing each as OData entities

and

- OData::InMemorySchema::Base -- this takes in a list of objects which are exposed as OData entities

The accessible OData service will be a read-only provider.

This code is not heavily tested.  It is alpha quality at best. Expect the API to change drastically over time.

## Resources

**OData V4**:

* http://www.odata.org
* http://www.odata.org/documentation

## Dependencies

Rails 4 or higher.

## Installation

Put this line in your Gemfile:

```
gem 'odata_server'
```

Run the bundle command to install it.

Then add the following lines to an initializer (ex: `odata_server.rb`):

```
# ActiveRecordSchema

ar_schema = OData::ActiveRecordSchema::Base.new('AR', classes: Foo)
OData::Edm::DataServices.schemas << ar_schema

# OR

OData::Edm::DataServices.schemas << OData::ActiveRecordSchema::Base.new
```

By giving a list of classes to ActiveRecordSchema, it will represent only theses classes. Without `classes` option, all the models will be represented.
ActiveRecordSchema can take a `reflection` option too (default is false): if true the models associations will be shown.

```
# InMemorySchema

class Foo
  attr_reader :foo, :bar, :baz

  def initialize(foo, bar, baz)
    @foo = foo
    @bar = bar
    @baz = baz
  end

  def sel.all
    (1..20).map do |n|
      Foo.new(n, "test", "test #{n}")
    end
  end
end

inmem = OData::InMemorySchema::Base.new("InMem", classes: Foo)
OData::Edm::DataServices.schemas << inmem
```

ActiveRecordSchema and InMemorySchema can either take a single classe or an array of classes.

Then, mount the `OData::Engine` in `routes.rb`:

```
mount OData::Engine, at: '/service/OData'
```

Restart your sever and you can visit the `/service/Odata` url that is the service base.

See https://github.com/lmcalpin/odata_provider_example_rb for an example application that
uses this gem.

## TODOS

* Update the core for OData v4
* Add support for `$search` option
* Update and add more tests
